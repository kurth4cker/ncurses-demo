ncurses-demo
===============
demo programs for ncurses learning. They are generally examples from
ncurses-intro and NCURSES-programming-HOWTO from ncurses home page
(https://gnu.org/software/ncurses).

Building
--------
You can just type `make' to build. There is no installation yet. Just
run demo programs with `./program_name'. Or copy them to anywhere in
your path. `$HOME/.local/bin' or `/usr/local/bin' recommended.

If you want to build panel library related demo programs just go to
panel subdirectory and run again `make'.
